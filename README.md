# My Profolio
## Introduction
This is my personal website, and there are two purposes for developing this website: 1. to provide a platform for people to know more about me, and 2. to practice the `React` framework and responsive `CSS` layout.
## Tools
**Language**: `JavaScript`  `SASS`  `HTML`

**Framework/Library**: `React` `EmailJS` 

## Features
**Responsive Layout**: This function is achieved using `CSS media queries`, which allows the website to run on different devices without affecting user experience.

**Navigation Bar**: Basic `DOM` knowledge and `React hooks` are used to create the navigation bar. The Icon changes color according to the user's position in the document and has a function to navigate to different sections.

**Interesting Animations**: Based on personal interests, some interesting animation effects were created using `DOM` knowledge and `CSS` techniques, making the overall website more interesting and interactive.

**Contact**: The functionality of sending an email to my personal email address from my website is implemented using `EmailJS` and `JavaScript asynchronous functions`.
